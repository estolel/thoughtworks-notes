Software Development Life Cycle
	-There is a gap between Customers/BAs, Dev Teams but bridged by Agile. However Agile has a gap between Ops and the Developers
	-This gap is fixed by DevOps where the Development and Operations are bridged.


Devops
	- Must CONTINUOUSLY provide value to customers.
	- Develop and Operate NOT Developers and Operations
