Tasking process
	- Splitting complex problems to simple tasks(can be done in 15mins)
	- Make sure tasks are independent
	- Make sure tasks are executable

	--SimpleTask: Easy to read and understand
	--Independent: Division of Labor and Independent testing
	--Verifiable: Input & Output

	1. Clarify
	2. List Tasks
	3. Define Input and Output
	4. Draw Context Map

Summary:
	Requirement > Analyze/Clarify > Tasking > Context Map > Coding


	Example: Find the "largest eveb bynber" in the set and check if it is greater than 10.
	
	1. Find all even numbers
		1.1 Input: numbers:[]
		1.2 Output: evenNumbers:[]
	2. Find the largest number
		2.1 numbers:[]
		2.2 Output: number:int
	3. If greater than 10
		3.1 Input: number: int
		3.2 Output: isGreaterThan10: boolean

*can represent a process as a concept in Context Maps

Context Map:
 - Function Block[Box]
 - Function Name [inside the Box]
 - Inputs and Outputs[Arrows]
 - IO Labels [On the Arrows]
